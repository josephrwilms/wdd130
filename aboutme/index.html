        Hello all! My name is Joseph Williams currently in Alberta Canada. I'm recently married to the love
        of my life, Deneile. I come from a family of 6 with two brothers and a sister.

        I love computers, hiking, camping and spending time with friends. I currently work as a junior developer
        and hope to continue down that path as a I acquire a degree in software development.

        I have been a member of the church my whole life and recently returned home from a mission in the Canada Montreal
        Mission. I was also recently called to a be a young men's advisor, so I am incredibly excited to work with the young men and be an example like others before me!
